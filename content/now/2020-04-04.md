I don't think I've ever lived a month where things have changed so drastically so quickly.

My activities really haven't changed that much. I never went out much; I just go out even less now.

I'm still serving as a TL for [Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com)'s iOS program. This will last until the end of May, at which point I'll move onto Labs, an 8-week cross-platform team project where we build a functioning app from scratch. After that will be the 6-week Computer Science portion of the curriculum, and then "Lambda X," which is essentially portfolio polish and job search.

I've recently started playing with [Godot](https://godotengine.org) game engine. I want to actually finish a game with it. So far I can make the player character move and rotate with the camera. I also made a couple of neat little sprites!

I've been playing some games with friends when I can; *Bloodborne*, *Minecraft*... hoping to buy a *Jackbox* game and play that sometime with more friends. Also been doing some [random streaming on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/Junebash), playing games, programming... maybe meditating?

Still playing music for fun. Started playing guitar more often lately, sometimes with Elie on clarinet.
