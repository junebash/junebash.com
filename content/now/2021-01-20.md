Things have been pretty great.

This week I began working as an iOS Developer at [Redzone Software](https://rzsoftware.com/). They make a suite of software suite for managing production at factories. All of my new coworkers have been incredibly welcoming. I have a lot to learn, but I'm really excited to be working there.

The USA finally has a president of whom I'm not completely and utterly ashamed.

I've been slowly making my way through *The Last of Us pt. 2* again on Grounded Mode. Gotta get that trophy. Also slowly working through the hilarious and mind-bending *Baba is You*. Considering starting *Stardew Valley*, which for some reason I never got into (I think the warnings from friends of its addictive qualities steered me away...).

Also, not changing this formally anywhere just yet (well, except Github), but I'm changing my name to June and using they/them pronouns now. More on that later.
