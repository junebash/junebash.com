It has once again been two years since my last update. Oof, what has happened in the past two years?

I'm now an engineering manager at Redzone. It was really hard at first, but I finally feel like I've somewhat gotten the hang of it and am enjoying it.

Lately, I've been playing around with dictation software. I always kind of poo-pooed it for anyone other than those who really needed it, but honestly it's been pretty cool and fun. I'm also using Claude Code a lot, and it helped me a ton with this website revamp. I've been really happy with the results. It obviously has its limitations, but as long as you're aware of those, I can't recommend it enough.

I've been listening to a lot of Rob Burbea talks. Right now, I'm going through his series on Soul and Sila. I'm finding it very fascinating and it's making me think a lot.
