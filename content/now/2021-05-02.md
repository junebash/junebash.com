Not a ton has changed since the last update. Still working at Redzone. Still working on some side-projects. There's been a bit more movement on at least one of them.

I've been playing *Nier Replicant*. It's fantastic. I played the first hour or two of the original when it first came out, but for some reason never finished it. I seem to remember it being a little bit janky, but this new version at least feels quite polished.

The weather is getting sunnier! Enough for me to get a pretty gnarly sunburn on my legs (after a lifetime of not wearing shorts it was easy to forget just how prone to sunburns I am). My hair's getting longer (it's been probably a year and a half since it got cut).

I've been feeling the pull of doing a meditation retreat. I tried to do an at-home one once or twice, but... it's difficult to maintain "retreat mode" in the midst of the familiar comforts of home. I may need to rent an AirBnB if I'm not able to make it to Cloud Mountain sometime soon. We'll see!
