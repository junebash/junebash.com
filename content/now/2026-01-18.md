Just been chilling. Trying to live. Trying not to despair at the state of the world. Trying to do what good I can. Trying to do and be better. Trying to take care of my 3 furry daughters and 2 furry sons and hang out with my fiancée.

But also! I'm actually working on music. Something will be out by the end of the month. Mark my words.

Also, I've released some open source code! Finally! A couple of Swift libraries. Find them on Github if you're so inclined.

I'm also closer than ever to releasing the first app I've built solo in years. It's a meditation timer.

I bought a [white noise machine](https://yogasleep.com/products/dohm-nova-sound-machine-and-night-light) and it's glorious. I put my phone across the room. I'm reading books on my Kindle. I should have done this so long ago.

I'm trying to make this a year of substantiality. Spending my time on substantial things that have substance. Not idling my days away. Reading books and spending less time on my phone. In a way that's actually sustainable. I think I'm doing pretty well so far! Definitely better than I have other times I've tried similar things. Also [bullet journaling](https://bulletjournal.com/). Highly recommend all of these.
