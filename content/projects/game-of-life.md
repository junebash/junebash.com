This is a simple implementation of [**Conway's Game of Life**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) using SwiftUI (with a bit of UIKit under the hood). It includes controls for map size, generation speed, randomization, manual cell input. [You can read more about it on my blog here](/posts/2020-06-24-game-of-life/).
