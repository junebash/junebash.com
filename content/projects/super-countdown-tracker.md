My first "real" iOS app, **Super Countdown Tracker** began life as a Lambda School build week project, and I liked it so much I decided to polish it up and put it on the app store. It's a simple, lightweight app that does one thing very wellâ€”it tells you how much time is left until the events you feed it. It also features tags, notes, sorting, filtering, auto-archive, and a custom, automatic, adaptive light/dark theme. Find it [on the iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/super-countdown-tracker/id1484864299?ls=1)!
