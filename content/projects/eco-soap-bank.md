This was a project for the [non-profit organization **Eco-Soap Bank**](http://ecosoapbank.org), which employees women local to developing areas around the world to distribute recycled soap and other products from hotels. This app is for hotel partners to track shipments and payments. It was made with a mix of UIKit and SwiftUI, utilizing the coordinator design pattern. We also notably opted to interface with GraphQL without using the usually-recommended Apollo framework, which actually worked out quite well.
