Hi! I'm June! I'm a software developer (primarily Swift and iOS), engineering manager, failed composer, occasional writer, Buddhist meditator, trans lady, and a bunch of other stuff. Welcome to my little personal corner of the internet!

Here you can read some of my thoughts, look at some of the things I've made, listen to some music I've made, and find out what I'm up to.
