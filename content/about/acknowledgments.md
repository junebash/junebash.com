Without the following people, my life would certainly not be where it is today.

- My partner Tori, who brings immense joy and love to my life every day
- My cats and dog, my best friends in the whole wide world
- Elie, who supported me through absolutely everything, believed in me when even I didn't, inspired me... I can't possibly say enough about how wonderful her presence has been in my life
- My parents, who raised me to be kind, work hard, reach high, do good, and love
- Sarah, who put up with my (perhaps inevitable) brattiness as a child and today welcomes me into her and her family's lives at every opportunity
- Carl, who I wish I had been closer to, and who I miss every day
- Ann, Tim, & Abel, who were a second family to me for over a decade
- My music teachers over the years; Vern Fosket, Christopher Bianco, Roger Briggs, Bruce Hamilton, Lesley Sommer, and so many more, who inspired me to live a life of creativity
- The iOS and other programming instructors at Lambda School, such as Spencer Curtis, Paul Solt, Dimitri Bouniol, and Beej Hall, from whom I learned and who helped me make the huge career change from music to software development; and particularly Ben Gohlke, who believed in me enough to hire me on my first job out of school and taught so many valuable lessons
- My coworkers at Redzone Software, who have helped me grow and kept me sane since 2021
- Tucker Peck and Upasaka Upali, whose instruction have helped me profoundly change my life for the better
- The many other lovely meditation teachers and spiritual friends with whom I've sat and studied
- Simon Grant, who's been a wonderful friend as I learned to navigate late college and adulthood
- The Tuggyloop gang, who has provided friendship, entertainment, and inspiration for years
- My dear ol' Friends of Satan, who showed me what infallible strength, friendship, and support looks like, and believed in me and in each other
- My friends in iOS11 and iOS15, who in each of their own ways inspired me and brought joy to my life while learning software development
- More folks than I can possibly remember in the game development and game audio communities, especially in Seattle and Vancouver
- Any and every other person who has been kind to me, done something helpful for me (and/or not for me), or believed in me... thank you sincerely.
