Hi! I'm June!

I was born in California and moved to the Pacific Northwest in 1997. In 2008, I began attending Western Washington University, where I graduated with a Bachelor of Music in 2013 and a Master of Music in 2015, both for Music Composition. I worked for two years as a program coordinator for the Music Department, then worked as an instructor of music theory for two more years. During this time I also worked as a composer, arranger, and performer, writing music for games, short & feature-length films, dance, and performers & ensembles such as the WWU Wind Symphony, Equus Sax Quartet, Bellingham Chamber Music Society, Whatcom Wind Ensemble, Jostaberry, and more. My music has been featured in films played at festivals across the US, most prominently in the cult horror films *Hunting Grounds* (*Valley of the Sasquatch* outside the US) and *The Last Laugh*.

In 2019, I finally realized how hard it was to make a living making music, so after many years of programming as a hobbyist, I began formally training remotely with Lambda School in software development (iOS emphasis). I soon developed a reputation for being a sharp, detailed programmer and a voracious learner, able to adapt swiftly (no pun intended) to new technologies, architectures, and environments. After internships as a Lambda School team lead and later an iOS developer with non-profit Eco-Soap Bank, I am currently working as an iOS developer at Redzone Software, where I've been since January 2021, and as engineering manager since February 2024.

With 15 years of programming experience, I specialize in crafting bespoke UI & architecture for iOS and macOS apps in a remote work environment. I have programmed apps, games, and websites using Swift, Objective-C, C, C++, Scala, Rust, C#, Lua, HTML, CSS, Python, Max/MSP, and more.

I currently live with my partner, two cats, and dog in Bellingham, WA.
