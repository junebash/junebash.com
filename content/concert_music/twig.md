This was the first piece I completed for WWU’s composition program after my acceptance. While I’d rather forget most of the rest of my pieces from that year, I’m still rather proud of this one, and it has continued to see many performances after its premiere, from its use in a dance choreography to a flute master-class focused on contemporary techniques and repertoire.
