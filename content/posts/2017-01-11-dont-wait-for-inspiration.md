A series of reminders for myself that you may find helpful:
<!-- more -->
<ul>
 	<li>Don't wait for inspiration to get to work.
<ul>
 	<li>Remember what Dr. Briggs always said: "[Creative work] is 10% inspiration and 90% perspiration."</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Don't wait for the perfect timing.</li>
 	<li>Don't wait to feel motivated.</li>
 	<li>Don't wait for the right opportunity.</li>
 	<li>Don't wait at all.</li>
 	<li>Consume less, create more. Put out more than you take in.
<ul>
 	<li>What you do take in, make sure it's worthwhile. Cut out what isn't.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Remember what matters. Forget what doesn't.</li>
 	<li><em>Weniger, aber besser</em>; less, but better.</li>
 	<li>Focus on what you have power and control over, and accept what you do not.</li>
 	<li>If you have something else you need to do, get to it. Get it done with. Then get to work on your art. No more lolly-gagging around. No more self-pity. No more excuses.</li>
 	<li>Get to work. This is already the moment you've been waiting for. Right now is literally the only chance you'll ever have. So take it.</li>
</ul>
