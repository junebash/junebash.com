In September I released two covers as a single called *Two Others' Songs*, featuring electro-pop-ish arrangements of "Here Comes a Thought" from *Steven Universe*[^1] and Radiohead's "How to Disappear Completely"[^2] from *Kid A*. You can listen to it on all of your favorite music platforms...<!-- more -->

Both songs have a certain meditative bent to them (the first moreso than the second), so I thought they went well together.

## "Here Comes a Thought"

I first heard this song in September 2017, and it simultaneously destroyed me and partially encouraged me to throw a lot more energy into meditation and my mental health. It's still probably the best song about meditation that I know of.

It also encouraged me to finally watch *Steven Universe*, which has since become one of my favorite shows.

This cover sort of began writing itself in my head over the summer. It was so fun to arrange; I don't think I've ever had this much fun writing a drum part, and I got to use a lot of my favorite instruments (clarinets, electric piano, choir-y multi-tracked vocals, arp-y synths).

Somehow the idea to change the time signature from 4/4 to 6/8 landed in my brain and wouldn't release itself. This led to a lot of challenges in modifying the whole flow of the tune, especially in the "take a moment" sections. I opted to make most of them slower and more meditative, whereas the second iteration is more frantic and rushed. Both takes reflect different angles on the meditative experience nicely, I think.

The clarinets are another idea that wouldn't let go of me. There's a fun technique I stole from John Adams where the 3 clarinets trade off on patterns, making it sound like one continuous pattern that's swirling around the listener[^3].

After finishing, it feels weird to go back to the original tune; it feels different (and uhhh definitely better than my own arrangement), but at the very least I enjoyed the hell out of putting my own warped spin on it.

## "How to Disappear Completely"

If "Here Comes a Thought" marked a period of late-20s angst, this Radiohead tune probably best stands in for some of my late-high school angst. I had a hard time deciding whether to put this first or second, but I opted to start off more cheerfully. Really it could go either way, but I think thematically this tune somehow feels less "mature," which is somewhat ironic seeing as "Here Comes a Thought" comes from an animated family-friendly TV show and "How to Disappear Completely" is a track from arguably one of the most significant albums of the past couple of decades.

I again switched up the time signature, this time in the other direction from 6/8 to 4/4. I had intended to do most of the instruments in this track using [VCV Rack][]{:target="_blank"}, but that ended up proving to be more cumbersome than I had hoped. I still ended up doing the hi-hats, some synth flourishes, some samples, and some glitchy stuff using VCV Rack.

[Glitch 2](https://illformed.com){:target="_blank"} from Illformed got some heavy use, especially on the drums. My usual workflow for that plugin is generally to put it on the drums, record the output to a new track, and flip between different settings, then find the best bits of that to use as "drum fills" essentially. I might have borrowed this technique from Disasterpeace, who I believe did something similar on the *Fez* soundtrack?

For most of the synths, I used several instances of [NI Massive](https://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/komplete/synths/massive) (still on the old version). It's an extremely versatile synth, but I often find myself making the same dreamy, vibrato-y, retro-y sawtooth wave, or something derived from that sound.

The original track's bassline is pretty weird; it walks around unchanging while the harmony changes around it, somehow adapting to every chord it accompanies. I stuck with that for parts of the intro and first verse, but it seemed to be begging for something a little groovier with this particular drumbeat. I did end up repurposing the original line to become an accompanimental plucky synth (also Massive) in the second verse.

I couldn't resist throwing in more choir-y vocals. I can't get enough of them.

I had planned to do more tunes and make an EP, but essentially ran out of time. I still thought this put a nice bow on one period of my life, though.
