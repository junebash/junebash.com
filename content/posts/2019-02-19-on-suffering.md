> Considering that all living beings are subject to pain and suffering, it is morally incumbent upon us to endeavor to refrain from causing any avoidable and unnecessary pain and suffering to any living being. Furthermore, we should undertake, through positive action wherever possible, to prevent the avoidable and unnecessary pain and suffering of living beings.

â€” Culadasa, in [a retreat handout from 2012](http://s3.amazonaws.com/dharmatreasure/BuddhadharmaWestPartsIIandIII.pdf)
