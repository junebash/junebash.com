It's been awhile! I'm going to start writing stuff over on [this other website](https://junebash.bearblog.dev/hello/). Find me over there! You can also [find me on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/junebash.bsky.social) because <del>Twitter</del> X is a shit-show.

_[edit: 2025-06-28]: This didn't end up lasting very long! Turns out I like having ownership of my stuff, and LLMs take a lot of the friction out of the process so I can just write the words and let the computer handle the rest._
