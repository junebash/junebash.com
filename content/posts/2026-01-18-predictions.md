I like predictions. I like wild predictions. Let's make some wild predictions about 2026!

These are going to be from all over my areas of interest. I will be jumping all over the place. I am not sorry.

I am basing this all entirely on vibes. I have no insider knowledge. This is just guessing based on what I'm seeing and on past experience.

### Apple will open-source something that's been closed source for years

Maybe it's SwiftUI. UIKit. I don't know, something is going to get open-sourced that hasn't been open-sourced before. This is probably just high grade copium.

### A game from a big studio will be announced that was mostly made with AI and it will be dogshit

Maybe EA or Epic or Bethesda or something. It'll be an "experiment". But they'll think it's really cool and release a big trailer at like the Game Awards or something and they'll be real proud that it was made with AI and it's coming in 2027. And the trailer will just be... utter garbage.

Or maybe they'll just surprise-release this experiment this year! And then we'll get to actually experience how dogshit it is!

### AI coding tools will break one more barrier of some sort but then will stop getting better

I don't know what that barrier will look like; I keep hearing the term "inflection point" but I kinda hate it for the same reason I hate the word "synergy". But in any case, we'll have some kind of situation where suddenly AI will be able to do a bunch of stuff people didn't think possible before, and folks will be excited for like a month, and they'll be bracing for the next big thing... but it will never come. Ever. It'll all be done getting better. And then in 2027 the bubble will pop.

### AOC will announce her run for presidency

And at first people will doubt she has any chance, but she'll slowly win over more and more folks, even centrists who finally see that leaning more towards the left is a viable strategy.

### Gavin Newsom will be involved in a scandal and a lot of Democrats won't care

He'll like, be in some stupid cheating scandal or something, and really entrenched Democrats will still support him for way too long.

### We'll get some weird new way to make coffee

We've got pourover, espresso, French press, etc. Someone will make some new novel way to make coffee that's kinda easy, and people will like it a lot.

### Tea starts to _really_ get popular in the USA

Tea still feels like a bit of a niche. I think some celebrity will start talking about tea on TikTok and a bunch of folks will be really into it. It'll be hip.

### Analog is cool

This is already happening a little bit I think, but it'll reach new heights. You'll see Gen-Z-ers with physical notebooks, reading physical books, going no-phone, "raw-dogging" life. There will be like, ABC News features about it and shit.

### He'll die in a really stupid way

And the world will laugh.
