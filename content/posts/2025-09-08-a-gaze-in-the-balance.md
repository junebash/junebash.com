I wrote a poem. I've never really been one for poetry.

> Birthed from resentment   
> Repeated and frantic   
> While waltzing through trenches     
> Withholding compassion   
>
> Beaches of glass   
> Oh, what wicked companions   
> Allayed at my feet   
> Extolled and expanded   
> 
> What love could be given   
> I've taken and stabbed at   
> You've held me back bravely   
> But strayed at the outset   
> 
> This barking of rage   
> Responded with sadness   
> Just one drop of shame   
> A gaze in the balance
