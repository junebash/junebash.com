I wrote a poem. I've never really been one for poetry.

> birthed from resentment   
> repeated and frantic   
> while waltzing through trenches    
> withholding compassion   
> 
> beaches of glass   
> oh, what wicked companions   
> allay through their seething   
> extolling, expanded   
> 
> what love could be given   
> I've taken and stabbed at   
> you've held me back bravely   
> but strayed at the outset   
> 
> this barking of rage   
> responded with sadness   
> just one drop of shame   
> a gaze in the balance
