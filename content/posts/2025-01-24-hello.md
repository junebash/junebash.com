Greetings! It's been awhile since I've written something long-form publicly. [Three and a half years, to be more precise.](https://www.junebash.com/blog/) Not for lack of want; more for lack of followthrough. 

I have ADHD and anxiety, a combination which makes stimulant medications a bit of a catch-22, and I've prioritized other stuff, like just enjoying my life. Unfortunately I also have a desire to fiddle with stuff and "do it myself," so I've tried to maintain a Jekyll-based website and self-host my website and stuff but... honestly I just, as my British coworkers might say, "can't be fucked anymore." 

So, inspired by [my friend Megan](https://magmacranes.bearblog.dev), I'm outsourcing the hard part and focusing on just writing stuff and hitting the 'publish' button now! I hope you'll tune in! I don't know how often I'll write here, but hopefully more than once every 3.5 years!
