**Swift Sequence Builder** is a utility library that leverages Swift's result builders to enable efficient and flexible sequence construction. It allows developers to build arrays and other sequences using declarative syntax with support for conditional elements and mixed collection types.

The library demonstrates advanced Swift language features, providing an intuitive API for constructing sequences dynamically while maintaining type safety and performance through lazy evaluation where possible.
