I made this very website you're now reading! This was originally built with Jekyll, but has been completely migrated to Zola with the Apollo theme. The migration involved converting 67 blog posts from YAML to TOML frontmatter, migrating all assets, and enhancing the site structure with better navigation and taxonomy. The site is now faster, more maintainable, and features improved content organization.
