*Note: This app is no longer available on the App Store.*

My first "real" iOS app, **Super Countdown Tracker** began life as a Lambda School build week project, and I liked it so much I decided to polish it up and put it on the App Store. It was a simple, lightweight app that did one thing well—telling you how much time was left until the events you added.
