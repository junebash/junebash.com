Add the dates/times of important events in the near or distant future, and Super Countdown Tracker will tell you how much time is left.

My first "real" iOS app, **Super Countdown Tracker** began life as a Lambda School build week project, and I liked it so much I decided to polish it up and put it on the app store. It's a simple, lightweight app that does one thing very wellâ€”it tells you how much time is left until the events you feed it.
