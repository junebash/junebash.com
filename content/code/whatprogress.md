**WhatProgress** is a command-line tool that helps you visualize the passage of time. Inspired by the memento mori tradition, it displays progress bars showing how far along you are through various time periods—today, this week, this month, this year, or your entire life.

Run `whatprogress -p life -b 1990-01-15` to see a sobering (or motivating) view of where you stand. It also supports custom ranges for tracking any numeric progress.
