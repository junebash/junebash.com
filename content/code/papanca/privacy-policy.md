## Summary

Papanca stores all data locally on your device. We don't collect, transmit, or sell your personal information. There are no accounts, no analytics, and no tracking.

## Data Storage

Stored on your device only:

- Session history (date, duration, and completion status of your meditation sessions)
- Timer presets and configurations
- App preferences and settings

This data never leaves your device unless you explicitly choose to back up your device through iCloud or iTunes.

## HealthKit Integration

Papanca can optionally write Mindful Minutes to Apple Health. This feature:

- Requires your explicit permission
- Only writes data (session duration) — we don't read your health data
- Is handled entirely by Apple's HealthKit framework
- Can be disabled at any time in Settings

We have no access to your HealthKit data. It stays on your device and in your iCloud Health data (if you have that enabled with Apple).

## Third Parties

Papanca contains no:

- Analytics SDKs
- Advertising frameworks
- Social media integrations
- Third-party tracking

We don't share data with anyone because we don't have access to it.

## Children's Privacy

Papanca does not collect personal information from anyone, including children under 13.

## Changes

If this policy changes, we'll update the "Last updated" date above. Significant changes will be noted in app update release notes.
