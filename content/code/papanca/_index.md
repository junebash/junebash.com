**Papanca** is a meditation timer designed to support your practice without getting in the way. No accounts, no subscriptions, no distractions — just a simple, focused tool for sitting.

## Why Papanca?

Most meditation apps want to guide you, track you, or sell you something. Papanca takes a different approach: it gives you the tools you need for self-guided practice and then steps aside.

Set a duration or meditate open-ended. Add interval bells if you want gentle reminders. Save presets for your regular sits. That's it.

## Features

- **Flexible timing** — Set a specific duration or meditate open-ended; you're in control
- **Interval bells** — Optional bells at regular intervals to gently anchor your attention
- **Presets** — Save your favorite configurations for one-tap starts
- **Session tracking** — Review your practice history and see your stats over time
- **HealthKit sync** — Optionally log sessions as Mindful Minutes in Apple Health
- **Eyes-closed friendly** — Large touch targets and haptic feedback for easy use during practice
- **Accessible** — Full VoiceOver and Dynamic Type support

## Privacy

Papanca stores all data locally on your device. There are no accounts, no analytics, and no tracking. Your practice is your own.
