I worked as a contractor with Rekor for a few months, during which time I worked on various aspects of this app, refinining the UI, fixing memory leaks and other issues, adding additional networking logic, and more. I also worked on another app, writing the entire project from scratch using in-house frameworks, SwiftUI, [Composable Architecture](http://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture), and more.
