# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a personal website built with Zola static site generator, using the Apollo theme. The site includes:

- **Blog posts** covering programming, music, philosophy, and personal topics
- **Now updates** with timeline-style presentation  
- **Project showcases** for code projects
- **Music page** for creative content and compositions
- **Clean navigation** with dedicated sections for different content types

## Key Commands

### Development
- `zola serve` - Start development server with live reload (typically runs on http://127.0.0.1:1111)
- `zola build` - Build the static site for production (outputs to `public/` directory)
- `zola check` - Validate the site without building (checks links and structure)

### Content Management
- Content files are Markdown with TOML frontmatter in the `content/` directory
- Posts go in `content/posts/` with pagination configured
- Now updates go in `content/now/` with chronological timeline presentation
- Projects go in `content/projects/`
- Music page at `content/music.md` with custom template for creative content
- Static assets go in `static/images/` directory

## Architecture

  - `productivity`, `workflow` (Productivity posts)
- Posts support tag assignment, comments, and date-based sorting
- Now updates use timeline-style presentation with `now`, `personal`, `updates` tags

### Theme Features
- Responsive design with dark/light theme toggle
- Social media integration (currently configured for Bluesky, GitHub, Bandcamp)
