<p>Well, it’s the end of the year. It’s been… a year. Many ups and downs, though mostly ups! Here’s some of what happened in 2014:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/2014/games/pandamensional">participated in the Global Game Jam</a> for the first time and met lots of cool folks and had a great time.</li>
  <li>I presented a paper on electroacoustic music, sound art, and spectromorphology in video games at the Ludomusicology Conference in Chichester, UK (this was my first time leaving North America and I happened to have my first panic attack upon arriving, but the trip overall was incredible).</li>
  <li>I finished work on <a href="http://outofnothingmovie.com/"><em>Out of Nothing</em></a>, on which I was the musician supervisor and score consultant.</li>
  <li>Had my piece <em>Machinations</em> premiered by the WWU Wind Symphony; I conducted!</li>
  <li>Elie moved back to Bellingham! Living apart from my wife was difficult, but we made it work while she student-taught in Seattle. Living together is much preferable.</li>
  <li>VR Trainers put out their final (and, IMO, best) album, <a href="https://vrtrainers.bandcamp.com/album/thrillwave"><em>Thrillwave</em></a>.</li>
  <li>I did music for a few more short promo videos and whatnot and <a href="http://atomic_swerve.itch.io/forerunner">game</a> <a href="http://gamejolt.com/games/action/freefall/31146/">jams</a> and whatnot.</li>
  <li>I published my own <a href="http://jonbash.github.io">hand-coded website</a>!</li>
  <li>I wrote music for my first feature-length film, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3231390/"><em>Valley of the Sasquatch</em></a>, which should see release sometime this year!</li>
  <li>I was commissioned to write a piece for brass, percussion, and video, a collaboration with Juliette Machado and Dr. Christopher Bianco, as an introduction to the Star-Spangled Banner.</li>
  <li>Technically my wife’s life, not mine, but Elie got a full-time teaching position at Mt. Baker Middle School in Mt. Vernon!</li>
</ul>

<p>I’d like to think I also improved my work ethic significantly. Getting things completed has always been difficult for me, but I think I made significant strides especially since September (partially out of necessity with the intense schedule of writing music for a full-length movie!). I think going forward this will make my work better and more efficient.</p>

<p>There were a fair number of things that didn’t work out this year that I was hoping would, some of which I’m still hoping will eventually see the light of day, but those things happen.</p>

<p>This year will see me finishing my master’s degree (DONE WITH COLLEGE AT LAST… until my [possible] doctorate), hopefully working on more games and films, the premiere of <em>Valley of the Sasquatch</em>, the release of my first solo album in five years, moving into a new home, getting a cat, and much more I’m sure. You can never predict these things, but I’m looking forward to whatever challenges and opportunities come my way.</p>
