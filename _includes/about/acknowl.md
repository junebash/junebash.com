Without the following people, my life would certainly not be where it is today.

- My best friend, Elie, who was supported me through absolutely everything, has believed in me when even I haven't, has inspired me... I can't possibly say enough about how wonderful her presence has been in my life
- My parents, who raised me to be kind, work hard, reach high, do good, and love
- Sarah & Carl, who put up with my (perhaps inevitable) brattiness as a child and today welcome me into their lives at every opportunity
- Ann, Tim, & Abel, who have been a second family to me in every single way
- My music teachers over the years; Vern Fosket, Christopher Bianco, Roger Briggs, Bruce Hamilton, Lesley Sommer, and so many more, who inspired me to live a life of creativity
- The iOS and other programming instructors at Lambda School, such as Spencer Curtis, Paul Solt, Dimitri Bouniol, and Beej Hall, from whom I learned and who helped me make the huge career change from music to software development; and particularly Ben Gohlke, who believed in me enough to hire me on my first job out of school and taught so many valuable lessons
- Tucker Peck and Upasaka Upali, whose instruction have helped me profoundly change my life for the better
- The many other lovely meditation teachers with whom I've sat and studied
- Simon Grant, who's been a wonderful friend as I learned to navigate late college and adulthood
- The Tuggyloop gang, who has provided friendship, entertainment, and inspiration for years
- My dear Friends of Satan, who have showed me what infallible strength, friendship, and support looks like, and believed in me and in each other
- My friends in iOS11 and iOS15, who in each of their own ways inspired me and brought joy to my life while learning software development; I'll never forget them
- eSangha, who since welcoming me in have been a beautiful anchor in times good and bad
- More folks than I can possibly remember in the game development and game audio communities, especially in Seattle and Vancouver; I'll name all of the folks I can think of in a reasonable amount of time: Matthew M, Gordon M, Ryan I, Akash T, Em H, Maris T, Damian K, Carlye N, Andrew N, Megan C, Josie B, Shannon M, Adrien T, Luca, Tammy D, Ryro, Rachel S... and many, many, many more that I can't recall
- Any and every other person who has been kind to me, done something helpful for me (and/or not for me), or believed in me... thank you sincerely.
