Well look at that, it's been almost two years since I updated this thing!

Still have my day job and various side-projects that have barely moved, and honestly, don't count on any of them moving! It's just not where my priorities are.

After almost two years of barely meditating, I'm finally getting back into that. It's been refreshing!

A little over a year ago my cat Cougar died. It was really hard. Shortly thereafter I got two other cats, Vincent and Hazel. They're a handful!

A lot more has obviously happened over the past two years, but I don't really feel the need to share any of it here. If you're really curious, you can find me on social media or email me or something.
