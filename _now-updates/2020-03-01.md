- Working as a team lead (TL) at [Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com){:target="_blank"}. It's a paid intership similar to a TA at a traditional college, but full-time (my classes are temporarily on hold).
- Building various frameworks and apps and such.
- Starting the process of applying for software development jobs!
- Playing through *Bloodborne* again, as well as playing through *The Witcher 3* for the first time. I recently (finally) played *Untitiled Goose Game*, which was delightful.
- Sitting down at the piano or drumset and just playing, every now and then.
